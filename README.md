# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Build a Logistic Regression Model to assign lead score to each lead
# Case Study Description
X Education gets lots of leads, but conversion rate is poor
Company wants to efficiently identify most potential leads which are known as 'Hot Leads'
Successful identification of Hot Leads will increase the conversion rate as sales team will now focus more on communicating with potential leads rather than making calls to everyone
We are required to build a model where we need to assign lead score to each of the leads such that customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance.
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
# Solution : Selection of HOT LEADS
